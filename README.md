The Gaul’s RPG Handbook: Conquer the Romans, Defeat the Odds

Welcome, Brave Gaul!
Congratulations on opening this guide. You’re about to embark on an epic RPG adventure where the only thing standing between you and victory is the endless tide of Romans (and their uncanny ability to never learn from their mistakes). Your job? To outsmart, outwit, and send every Roman soldier packing—all with nothing but your cleverness, a magical potion, and a big dose of Gaulish confidence.
No need for shields, no need for armor—Asterix never needed those to take down a hundred Romans. All you need is your sharp mind, quick thinking, and, of course, a deep-seated love of freedom (and maybe a little help from some magic potion).
Get ready for a quest where Romans fall at your feet, and the only thing you’ll need to worry about is how to make them stay down. No food required—just pure strategy and an unbreakable will!

Levels and Difficulty


Level 1: Easier Than Level 2

In Level 1, you'll face a more relaxed introduction to the game. The challenge here is to familiarize yourself with the controls, environment, and enemies. You won’t face too many Romans, so this level is all about preparing for what's to come.
However, Level 2 is a much tougher challenge. Here, you'll face more Romans.


Load Inventory from Previous Games

If you choose to load your inventory from previous games, it will carry over only the items in your inventory. Nothing else will change – just the items you’ve collected in earlier quests.

Panoramix's Potion Ingredients

You can gain recipes for crafting potions by interacting with Obelix.


How to Craft Panoramix's Potion

To craft Panoramix's potion, simply approach him and press the key for the potion you want to craft. However, be careful! If you don’t have the required ingredients, Panoramix will send you off. So, make sure you have the right ingredients before asking him to make the potion for you!


Types of Potions in Asterix's Quest RPG

All potion effects are permanent.

Description: When you're wounded and need a quick recovery, the Health Potion is your best friend. Drink it to fully restore your health, and get back into the fight!


Attack Potion

Effect: Increases your attack power to 3 (if your strength is > 3, it has no effect).

Speed Potion

Effect: Increases your speed x2.

Description: Need to outrun the Romans or dodge their attacks? This potion will boost your speed x2, making you faster and more agile. Perfect for when you need to get away... or get to the action faster!

How to Reach the Ingredients


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5934275-9248-44ac-9355-07f3cfe0b47c)



Some of the ingredients you need for crafting potions are located on islands across the water. However, Asterix is too small and afraid of water, so he can’t reach these ingredients directly. You need to obtain shoes from Obelix to be able to walk over the bridge, because Asterix has too small feet.

The Bridge to the Islands

To get to these ingredients, you'll need to use the bridge. The bridge will allow you to cross the water without having to face Asterix’s fear of water or his small size. Once you’ve crossed the bridge, you’ll reach the islands where you can gather the necessary ingredients, such as carrots, mushrooms, and others.


Tip: The bridge is the only way to access the islands, so be sure to use it when you’re ready to collect your ingredients!



Hero Stats: Asterix


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b90338b-35ff-42e1-bb83-96dc0e09ecff)



Health



Health: 10

Description: Asterix, the brave and clever Gaul, starts with full health and can take a few hits in battle. His health is important for surviving against the Romans and other challenges.


Attack



Attack: 1

Description: Asterix may not be the strongest fighter, but his wit and agility help him defeat enemies. His basic attack power is 1, making him capable of dealing damage, but you can increase his power with potions or items!


Mana



Mana: 5

Description: Asterix has a limited mana pool, starting with 5. Mana is consumed every time he performs an attack, so you’ll need to manage it carefully during battle. Fortunately, mana replenishes automatically every second, so make sure to wait for a recharge if needed!

Important Notes:


Mana Refill: Asterix’s mana refills every second. However, you need to be careful with your attacks as each one consumes mana. Plan your strategy wisely!

Health: Asterix has a decent amount of health, but be careful not to get overwhelmed by too many Romans!




How to Win the Game

It's simple – just defeat all the Romans and the game ends! That’s it! The ultimate goal of Asterix’s Quest is to take down the Roman invaders who stand in your way.
